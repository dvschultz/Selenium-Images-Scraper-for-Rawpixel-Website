# Selenium Images Scraper ðŸ•· for Rawpixel Website
This project scrape images from [rawpixel website](https://www.rawpixel.com/) that are on public domain.

## Prerequisites
* Install Chrome [Web Browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/).
* Install Chrome [WebDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads), just ensure version compatibility with you Chrome Web Browser version.
* Install `Python 3.7`.

## Requirements
* The `requirements.txt` file contain `Selenium` and `tqdm` libraries.
* Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, it's good to install dependencies in isolated Python virtual environment.

## Getting started
To start using this project you need to have account or create one in [rawpixel website](https://www.rawpixel.com/).

1. Open Chrome Web Browser in debugger mode.
    1. Navigate to where your Chrome Web Browser application (`chrome.exe`) is installed in your filesystem, and copy the path where it's installed.
    2. Add the path to system environment variable `i.e PATH` "make sure to not include `chrome.exe` in the path".
    3. Create new directory where to launch the browser. It's added to avoid conflict with your already installed Chrome Web Browser.
    4. Open command prompt `cmd`, and enter this command:
        ```
            chrome.exe -remote-debugging-port=9014 --user-data-dir="<absolute path to the created directory>"
        ```
        For Mac, use:
        ```
            Path/to/Chrome -remote-debugging-port=9014 --user-data-dir="<absolute path to the created directory>"
        ```
        The command will launch Chrome Web Browser window in debugging mode.
    5. In the opened window (tab) navigate to [rawpixel website](https://www.rawpixel.com/) and login with your account informations, then go to a public domain images album of your choice.
    <br>**NOTE:** This feature run on >= 63 version of chrome web browser only.

2. Next, you need to run `get_session_cookies.py` Python script. to save your session cookies. Here is the command to run:

    ```
    python code/get_session_cookies.py \
        --webdriver="<absolute path to chrome webdriver>"
    ```
    It will save session cookies in `cookies.pkl` file.

## Running the tests
3. Finally, you need to run `img_scraper_rawpixel.py` Python script, to downlowd images in in your specified directory. Here is the command to run:

    ```
    python code/img_scraper_rawpixel.py \ 
        --webdriver="<absolute path to chrome webdriver>" \
        --output_dir="<absolute path to output directory>" \
        --url="<url of your choice>"
    ```

### Command Arguments:
* `--webdriver` absolute path to where you saved Chrome WebDriver `chromedriver.exe`.
* `--output_dir` where to put downloded images.
* `--url` URL of public domain images collection in [rawpixel website](https://www.rawpixel.com/) (e.g: https://www.rawpixel.com/board/574376/les-roses-pierre-joseph-redoute-free-cc0-roses-illustrations?sort=curated&mode=shop&page=1)
